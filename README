This tool was originaly written by giapnguyen
( see https://github.com/giapnguyen/snmpbuilder)

from originam README:

	I write the tool because I'm tired in create SNMP items for zabbix.
	To create a useful zabbix's template for SNMP devices, I used to open a MIB
	browser to get correct OID then fill the zabbix's item forms.
	It'm so boring when create a long list of items :-( .
	There is a first attempt of work out this problem, zload_snmpwalk
	http://zabbix.com/wiki/howto/monitor/snmp/zload_snmpwalk.
	But I rather a GUI tool. So why just make one?

	SNMP builder is a add-in for Zabbix. It provide browse MIB for values and
	informations, automatically convert into Zabbix items and insert them
	into a template.
