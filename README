This tool was originaly written by giapnguyen
( see https://github.com/giapnguyen/snmpbuilder)

from original README (from giapnguen):

	I write the tool because I'm tired in create SNMP items for zabbix.
	To create a useful zabbix's template for SNMP devices, I used to open a MIB
	browser to get correct OID then fill the zabbix's item forms.
	It'm so boring when create a long list of items :-( .
	There is a first attempt of work out this problem, zload_snmpwalk
	http://zabbix.com/wiki/howto/monitor/snmp/zload_snmpwalk.
	But I rather a GUI tool. So why just make one?

	SNMP builder is a add-in for Zabbix. It provide browse MIB for values and
	informations, automatically convert into Zabbix items and insert them
	into a template.

Installation

Prerequisits: install snmp packet from your repo
Now let's go. I'm a bit ubuntu-centric, so please read carefully and make changes sutable for you.
(i'll mark all comments with '#', so you may copy-paste all to terminal or script):
-----------------
#1. download tar.gz file from github to your favorite directory
#	also name tar file $dist_name
# you may download by browser pointing to http://github.com/atimonin/snmpbuilder/tarball/master, or
wget --content-disposition http://github.com/atimonin/snmpbuilder/tarball/master

#2. Define some variables:
# Zabbix frontend document-root
# 	(for ubuntu it is /var/www/zabbix):
zabbix_frontend=/var/www/zabbix
# Your favorite directory for downloads (your current dir for ex.)
your_src=$PWD
# Downloaded tar filename (also directory later)
dist_name=`basename atimonin-snmpbuilder-* .tar.gz`
#
#
#3. untar needed files
tar xvzf $distname.tar.gz

#4. become an apache user (www-data for ubuntu, if not, you may see it from
#	ps aux|grep apache), it'll ask you for your password if you have appropriate permissions
sudo -s -u www-data <<END_OF_SCRIPT

#5. install images for snmpbuilder in zabbix frontend root directory

cd $zabbix_frontend
tar xvzf $your_src/$distname/snmpbuilder-2.0_imgs.tar.gz

#6. patch zabbix frontend
patch -p1 < $your_src/$distname/snmpbuilder-2.0.patch

#7. copy snmpbuilder files to frontend dir
cp -r $your_src/$distname/zabbix/* .

#8. if you need russian translation (if not, skip this step)
#	patch .po file and rebuild .mo
patch -p1 < $your_src/snmpbuilder-for-2.0.2/snmpbuilder-2.0-ru.patch
cd locale
./make_mo.sh

#9. All done, you are again you, exit from sudo
END_OF_SCRIPT
-----------------

Now restart apache: 
sudo service apache2 restart
 or
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
